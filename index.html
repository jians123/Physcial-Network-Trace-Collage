                    That’s 109 Cromwell Road, the corner of Ashburn Gardens. Ashburn Gardens still exists of course, but
                    the buildings you see in the picture do not.
                    <br>
                    There was an actual garden in Ashburn Gardens.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I don’t know if any of it survives. The site was cleared when the Penta Hotel was built but there
                    are still a few patches of open ground on the south west corner of the site. The hotel was built at
                    an angle to the road, possibly leaving one corner intact.

                    <br>
                    (The Architectural Review of September 1972 covered the completed building in an article called Bad
                    Dreams Coming True in which a number of then recent large hotels were given a critical mauling. The
                    Penta was called “a monster apparition.” The article is worth a look if you find yourself in the
                    vicinity of a copy)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are some mature trees on that corner today which could well be the ones you see in this nearly
                    fifty year old photograph. Or perhaps not.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Behind the buildings you see was Ashburn Place. This is the west side looking south, complete with
                    another of those signs sayingthe site had been acquired for that big new hotel. Is that a Mini-Moke?

                New York's City Hall is one of the oldest continuously used City Halls in the nation that still houses
                its original governmental functions. Designed by Joseph François Mangin and John McComb Jr. and
                completed in 1812, it is one of the finest architectural achievements of its period.

                    The old New York County Courthouse, commonly known as Tweed Courthouse, is located on the north side
                    of City Hall Park, behind City Hall, on Chambers Street between Centre Street and Broadway.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The courthouse was the first permanent government building erected by the City after the completion
                    of City Hall. The building is notable not only for the unparalleled artistry of its design and
                    decoration, but also for its association with one of New York’s greatest political scandals.

                    <br>
                    The three and one-half story building sits on a low granite curb with a rusticated marble basement.
                    The building is composed of a central section with two projecting wings, with an addition in the
                    center on the south facade. The entrance is marked by a pedimented portico supported by four
                    Corinthian columns. The windows have arched and flat stone pediments. There is a massive stone
                    cornice and an octagonal skylight at the roof, replacing a planned dome.

                    Largely referred to as Chicago's front yard, Grant Park and its immediate vicinity is a series of
                    green spaces which have always been in a constant state of change and renewal. As part of
                    Renovations Week, here is a look into the history of how a lakefront was shaped over the years.

                    In 1966 the City Hall building was designated a city landmark as well as a national landmark. The
                    park is home to more than a dozen monuments, including Frederick MacMonnies's statue of Colonial
                    patriot Nathan Hale (1893) and John Quincy Adams Ward's Horace Greeley (1890), which was moved to
                    the park in 1916.
