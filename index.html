                <p>
                    That’s 109 Cromwell Road, the corner of Ashburn Gardens. Ashburn Gardens still exists of course, but
                    the buildings you see in the picture do not.
                    <br>
                    There was an actual garden in Ashburn Gardens.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I don’t know if any of it survives. The site was cleared when the Penta Hotel was built but there
                    are still a few patches of open ground on the south west corner of the site. The hotel was built at
                    an angle to the road, possibly leaving one corner intact.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    (The Architectural Review of September 1972 covered the completed building in an article called Bad
                    Dreams Coming True in which a number of then recent large hotels were given a critical mauling. The
                    Penta was called “a monster apparition.” The article is worth a look if you find yourself in the
                    vicinity of a copy)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are some mature trees on that corner today which could well be the ones you see in this nearly
                    fifty year old photograph. Or perhaps not.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Behind the buildings you see was Ashburn Place. This is the west side looking south, complete with
                    another of those signs sayingthe site had been acquired for that big new hotel. Is that a Mini-Moke?
